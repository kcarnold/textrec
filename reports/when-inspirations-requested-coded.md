# ROUND 1
## None available
I tested the button once just to see what it would come up with. When none came up, that almost freed me up to develop ideas on my own.
I requested inspirations twice and realized I wasn't going to get any at all to use. I had to come up with them all myself.
I was a bit stumped a few times and tried to get fresh inspirations but there none available.

I requested a lot, but it never had anything at all. 
There were no inspirations.

## Not helpful
After coming up with 10 question, I decided to use the inspiration help. It did not help me because it only showed some short paragraphs about different topics, I really did not know what those paragraphs were referring to.
Multiple times, but they were completely useless so I eventually stopped
I thought I was stuck, but the inspirations were no help for this.
I tried to think of questions from the perspective from the reader but I kept on getting stuck since I already knew a lot about it and it was tough trying to send my mind back in time. I refreshed lots of inspirations but found them hardly useful.

I got stuck after a bit of course, so I used the inspirations. They helped me think of things that visitors unfamiliar with the place specifically might ask.
I was able to rattle off the first handful by myself, but I wanted to populate some inspirations just so I never had to get to the point that I was stuck. It helped a lot and this one was much easier than the previous two.

# Responses to "other"
It was great to have the inspiration, it helped.
harder than it looks
nice
The inspirations were good enough that I probably became overly reliant on them, rather than force myself to come up with more ideas on my own.
Apparently, my mind goes blank when it comes to this task. I felt a lot better with the inspirations.
