      you choose to participate, you may change your mind and leave the study at
      any time {platform === "turk" && "by returning the HIT"}. Refusal to

      We are studying how different text entry interfaces affect the writing
      process, writing outcome, and the author’s subjective experience, and how
      psychological factors may influence those effects.

      You will write using one or more different text entry interfaces. You
      should not include any personally identifiable information in what you
      write.

      Surveys in this study may include questions about your age, gender,
      personality, computer use, and other demographic information.
