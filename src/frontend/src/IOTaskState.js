At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013.\n\nAmnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases.\n\n\"The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),\" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN.\n\n\"A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition.\"\n\nDeath sentencing up\n\n\nCruel and unusual execution?\n\nIn South Korea, death doesn't mean death 01:33\nWhile the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013.\n\nThe report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, \"against scores of people in some cases.\"\n\nThe organization found \"positive developments\" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions.\n\nOpinion: Sharp spike in death sentences\nSub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013.\n\n\"Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,\" Gaughran said. \"Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region.\"\n\nThe resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region.\n\nLethal injection explained\nLethal injection explained 01:27\nSarandon: Death penalty not colorblind\nSarandon: Death penalty not colorblind 03:53\nIndonesia President: 'No compromise' for drug executions 01:26\nU.S. alone in western hemisphere\n\n\nThe United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year.\n\nThe U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes \"thousands\" of prisoners each year, \"more than the rest of the world put together.\"\n\nThe report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death.\n\n\"In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,\" the report stated. \"In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.\"\n\nU.N's Ban: A need to move away from death penalty\n\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment.\n\n\"The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,\" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October.\n\"We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights.\"\n\nAmnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.", "Seventy years ago, Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15.\n\nJust two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust.\n\nBut new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought.\nResearchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities.\n\nTheir journey after the annex\n\n\nIn 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.\n\nAnne Frank's final entry\nThat same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany.\n\nAnne Frank's cousin publishes letters 02:55\nDays at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call.\n\nHer classmate, Nannette Blitz, recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944: \"She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket; she couldn't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice.\"\n\nListen to Anne Frank's friends describe her concentration camp experience\nTheir final days\n\n\nAs the Russians advanced further, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became even more crowded, bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day.\n\nAnne Frank mementos found in attic\nAnne Frank mementos found in attic 06:25\nTyphus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever, chills and skin eruptions.\n\n\"Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes, Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period,\" museum researchers wrote.\n\nThey concluded that it's unlikely the sisters survived until March, because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7.\n\n\"Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear,\" wrote authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek.\nThe exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear. Margot died before Anne.\n\n\"Anne never gave up hope,\" said Blitz, her friend. \"She was absolutely convinced she would survive.\"\n\nHer diary endures as one of the world's most popular books.\n\nRead more about Anne Frank's cousin, a keeper of her legacy", "A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday.\n\nThe prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review.\n\nThe student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said.\n\nOfficials are still trying to determine if other people were involved.\n\nCriminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well.\n\nStudents and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\" after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media.\n\nAt a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered.\n\n\"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd.\n\nThe incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students.\n\nLast month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled.\n\nIn February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi.\n\nA statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus.\n\nIn the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \"cowardly act.\"\n\n\"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday.\n\nDuke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina.\n", "(CNN) The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories.\n\nThe formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based.\n\nThe Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\"\nLater that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well.\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead, the vast majority of them Palestinians.\n\nIsrael, which is not an ICC member, has opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body.\n\"The Israeli position -- like the position of the U.S., Canada and others -- is that the Palestinians are not eligible to join the ICC and the court does not have jurisdiction in this instance, first and foremost, because there is no Palestinian State in international law,\" Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"The decision of the Palestinians to join the ICC as an attempt to move 'processes' against Israel is political, cynical and hypocritical.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, which is allied to the \"murderous\" militant group Hamas, \"is the last one that can threaten to present a case to the ICC in the Hague,\" the ministry added, saying that the Palestinians' membership violated the founding principles of the ICC and risked politicizing the body.\n\nBut Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said joining the ICC was a move toward greater justice.\n\n\"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\"\n\nRights group welcomes Palestinian decision\n\n\nJudge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians.\n\n\"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said.\n\nRights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development.\n\n\"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group.\n\n\"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\"\n\nU.S.: We will oppose actions against Israel at the ICC\n\n\nIn January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries.\nPalestinian Authority bids to join the ICC\nPalestinian Authority bids to join the ICC 04:27\nThe United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court's decision.\n\n\"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement.\n\nIt urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said.\n\nBut the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\"\n\nWhile a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\"\n\nThe inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June.\n\nThe International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nCNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder, Michael Schwartz and Faith Karimi contributed to this report."];
//["editor's note: in our behind the scenes series, cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here, soledad o'brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill . an inmate housed on the``forgotten floor ,\"where many mentally ill inmates are housed in miami before trial . miami, florida (cnn )--the ninth floor of the miami-dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the``forgotten floor .\"here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court . most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer--charges that judge steven leifman says are usually``avoidable felonies .\"he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene--confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to leifman . so, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor'\"at first, it's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag--that's kind of what they look like . they're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud . we see two, sometimes three men--sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells .``i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here!\"one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way--if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges . it's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered``lunatics\"and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go? nowhere . the streets . they became, in many cases, the homeless, he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he's working to change this . starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the``forgotten floor\"will instead be sent to a new mental health facility--the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment . leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start . leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution . the patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and, for leifman, justice is served . e-mail to a friend.", "london, england (reuters )--harry potter star daniel radcliffe gains access to a reported

to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture\"in a plea agreement filed at u.s. district court in richmond, virginia . the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine,``full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release ,\"the plea deal said . federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines .``the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense ,\"the plea agreement said . in an additional summary of facts, signed by vick and filed with the agreement, vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won .``most of the ` bad newz kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by vick ,\"the official summary of facts said . gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators tony taylor, quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace, it continued .``vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights . vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by ` bad newz kennels .'\"vick also agreed that``collective efforts\"by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs . around april, vick, peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vick's property in virginia, the statement said .``peace, phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in ` testing' sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning .``vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace, phillips and vick ,\"the summary said . peace , 35, of virginia beach, virginia; phillips , 28, of atlanta, georgia; and taylor , 34, of hampton, virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences . vick , 27, is scheduled to appear monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge . see a timeline of the case against vick\"the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement . the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin .``it sometimes happens--not often--that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior ,\"toobin said friday .``the risk for vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of virginia could say, ` hey, look, you admitted violating virginia state law as well . we're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court .'\"in the plea deal, vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary . vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests . vick agreed to``make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated\"with the dogs that are being held by the government .``such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals .\"prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs . but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted co-conspirators . judge henry e. hudson issued an order thursday telling the u.s. marshals service to``arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property .\"both the judge's order and vick's filing refer to``approximately\"53 pit bull dogs . after vick's

presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end ,\"according to speech excerpts released tuesday by the white house .``three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left ,\"bush will say .``whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people ,' 're - education camps' and ` killing fields ,'\"the president will say . the president will also make the argument that withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility, citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam, according to the excerpts .``here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility, but the terrorists see things differently ,\"bush will say . on tuesday, democratic senate majority leader harry reid said,``president bush's attempt to compare the war in iraq to past military conflicts in east asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two . our nation was misled by the bush administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history .``while the president continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, american lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the iraqi government . it is time to change direction in iraq, and congress will again work to do so in the fall .\"the white house is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the american legion, as an effort to``provide broader context\"for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus, the top u.s. military commander, and ryan crocker, the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers--and the american people--to withhold judgment on his troop``surge\"in iraq until the report comes out in september . watch bush criticize the iraqi government\"it is being closely watched on capitol hill, particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month, defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans--64 percent--now oppose the iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam, bush in wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from asia, including the u.s. defeat and occupation of japan after world war ii and the korean war in the 1950s, according to the excerpts .``in the aftermath of japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom ,\"bush will say .``today, in defiance of the critics, japan...stands as one of the world's great free societies .\"speaking about the korean war, bush will note that at the time``critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that america's intervention was divisive here at home .\"`` while it is true that the korean war had its share of challenges, america never broke its word ,\"bush will say .``without america's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the south koreans after the war, millions

in some u.s. beekeeping operations--imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds . the u.s. department of agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the united states . more than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination . signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the united states in 2004, the same year american beekeepers started importing bees from australia . the disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone . the virus identified in the healthy australian bees is israeli acute paralysis virus (iapv )--named that because it was discovered by hebrew university researchers . although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with iapv die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis . for some reason, the australian bees seem to be resistant to iapv and do not come down with symptoms . scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that iapv was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time . but the study released thursday on the science express web site, operated by the journal

resistant to colony collapse .``there are no cases...in australia at all ,\"entomologist dave britton of the australian museum told the sydney morning herald last month .``it is a northern hemisphere phenomenon .\"bee ecology expert and university of florida professor jamie ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors . researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the u.s. mainland but are not found in australia . university of georgia bee researcher keith s. delaplane said thursday the study offers a warning--and hope .``one nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind ,\"said delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite .``but in the case of iapv, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder . this is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease - and pest-resistant .\"bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees .``the next step is to ascertain whether iapv, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce ccd -lsb- colony collapse disorder -rsb- in healthy bees ,\"said ian lipkin, director of the center for infection and immunity at columbia university mailman school of public health . besides the columbia and usda researchers, others involved in the study released thursday include researchers from pennsylvania state university, the pennsylvania department of agriculture, the university of arizona and 454 life sciences . e-mail to a friend.", "washington (cnn )--vice president dick cheney will serve as acting president
