    <p>
      For each keyboard design, there will be a practice round to get used to
      it, then you'll type {TRIALS_PER_CONDITION} captions using it, and finally
      a short survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will type a total of {baseConditions.length * TRIALS_PER_CONDITION}{" "}
      captions.
    </p>
    <p>Note:</p>
    <ul className="spaced">
      <li>
        All of the keyboard designs have a simplified key layout: no caps, and
        only a few symbols.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can't edit text you've already entered, other than by backspacing
        and retyping it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Autocorrect doesn't work. If you make a typo, please backspace and
        correct it.
      </li>

        At the end, you will be comparing your experiencecs between the
